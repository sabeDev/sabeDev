# 👋 Senior Software Engineer | Systems Integrator | Educator

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** specialising in backend integration, system automation, and data-driven internal platforms.  
My background spans **government, defence, banking & finance, and public-sector environments**, with experience designing solutions across complex enterprise ecosystems.

I build tools that connect platforms like **MECM, VMware, Oracle EBS, SQL Server, REST APIs**, and bring their data together into usable dashboards, automations, and web interfaces.

A former **teacher and Cisco instructor**, I bring strong communication skills, mentoring ability, and clarity of thought to engineering work.  
I naturally take ownership, steer direction, and support others — without needing the title.

## 🎯 What I Do

I focus on creating **practical, maintainable software** that integrates with operational systems:

- **Full-stack internal applications** using PHP, HTML5, JavaScript & jQuery  
- **Data extraction & transformation** from MECM, VMware, Oracle, MSSQL, REST APIs  
- **Dashboarding & visualisation** (Grafana + custom UIs)  
- **Automation & backend tooling** to optimise internal workflows  
- **Secure, reliable integration layers** between legacy and modern systems  

I’m also pursuing an **MSc in Computer Science**, having passed the first module *Programming & Program Design (Java)* with strong performance.
