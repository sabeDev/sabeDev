# Hi, I'm Simon 👋  

Senior Software Engineer & Integration Developer

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’ve spent many years designing and implementing full end-to-end solutions as a **Technical Architect, Consultant and Automation Engineer** – working with large enterprise environments, the System Center stack, Active Directory, networking, and virtualisation.

These days my focus is much more on **development and integration**:

- Building **PHP / HTML5 / JavaScript** applications
- Integrating and extracting data from **MECM (SCCM), VMware, Oracle, multiple MSSQL instances and various REST APIs**
- Turning raw platform data into **usable dashboards, reports and automations** (Grafana, custom web UIs, scripts)

I’m comfortable working solo or within a team, enjoy tackling complex problems methodically, and I learn new technologies fast (often coming into projects with ~70% of the stack and closing the gap quickly via lab work and experimentation).

I maintain a **home lab** to replicate production concepts so I can prototype safely, break things without fear, and then bring stable solutions back into customer / production environments.

## 🎯 What I’m Focusing On Now

- Modernising my work towards **full-stack development** using PHP, JavaScript and Python/Django  
- **Data integration & automation**: pulling from MECM, VMware, Oracle EBS, SQL Server and REST APIs into unified views  
- Building **licensing and infrastructure health dashboards** (Grafana & custom web UIs)  
- Improving my workflows with **GitHub**, **Terraform**, and **containerised environments** (Docker, Proxmox lab)

## 🧩 Things I Like Building

- 🔗 **Integration services** that connect “classic” enterprise platforms (MECM, VMware, Oracle, SQL Server) with modern web front-ends  
- 📊 **Dashboards & observability** – especially Grafana, or custom PHP/JS dashboards over SQL data  
- 🤖 **Automation**: patching pipelines, runbooks, scheduled tasks, and “glue code” tying multiple systems together  
- 🧱 **Licensing & inventory views** – surfacing complex licensing / asset data in a way that humans can actually use

## 🏢 Experience Snapshot

Some of the roles that shaped how I work today:

- **Senior Software Engineer @ NATO (2019 – present)**  
  - SmartTrack licensing & custom PHP development  
  - System Center automation, PowerShell scripting, Grafana dashboards  
  - SQL AlwaysOn troubleshooting and performance work  

- **DevOps Engineer @ UK Ministry of Justice (MOJ)**  
  - Azure hybrid infrastructure, Terraform builds, Git-driven IaaS  
  - S2S VPN, Virtual WAN, Azure Firewall, SCCM rebuilds and automation  

- **System Center Consultant / Technical Architect (multiple clients)**  
  - SCCM / SCOM / SCORCH / SCVMM designs (HLD/LLD)  
  - Automation runbooks, patching solutions, monitoring, and reporting  

Earlier in my career I managed large education networks, delivered Microsoft Academy training, and generally lived deep in Windows / System Center / infrastructure land – which now gives me a solid foundation when I’m building integrations and tools for operations teams.
