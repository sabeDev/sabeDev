# 👋 Senior Software Engineer | Systems Integrator | Educator / Mentor

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** specialising in backend integration, automation, and data-driven internal platforms.  
My career spans **banking & finance**, **government**, **defence & international organisations**, and **public-sector institutions**, designing systems across complex enterprise environments.

I build tools that integrate platforms like **Oracle EBS**, **SQL Server**, **REST APIs**, **SCOM**, **MECM**, and **VMware** transforming raw system data into clear dashboards, automation workflows, and modern web interfaces.

With a background in teaching (5 years), Cisco instruction, and ongoing MSc studies, I bring a balance of technical depth, communication clarity, and long-term thinking.  
I naturally take ownership, guide technical direction, and support those around me without needing the title.

## 🎯 What I Do

I focus on creating **practical, maintainable software** that enables teams to do more with their data:

- **Full-stack internal applications** using PHP, HTML5, JavaScript & jQuery  
- **Data extraction & transformation** across MECM, VMware, Oracle, MSSQL, and APIs  
- **Operational dashboards** for licensing, compliance, and infrastructure health  
- **Automation & backend services** to streamline internal workflows  
- **Integration layers** connecting legacy platforms with modern tooling  
- **Rapid prototyping** in my home lab before delivering production-ready solutions
